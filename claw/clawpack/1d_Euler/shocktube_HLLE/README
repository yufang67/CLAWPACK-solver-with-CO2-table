Euler equations with shock-tube initial data (a Riemann problem)
The shock-tube data is specified in setprob.data.


To plot a comparison of fine and coarse grid solutions,
first run code in subdirectory qref, then in main directory.

The reference solution (in ./qref) will be plotted on top of the
final computed coarse grid solution using the 'plotframe1ez' command
called from 'afterframe.m'.
