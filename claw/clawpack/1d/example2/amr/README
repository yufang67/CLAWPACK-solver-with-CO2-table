Acoustics equations with pressure pulse initial conditions,
solid wall at x=0, outflow at x=1.

The density and bulk modulus are specified in setprob.data


The code in this directory illustrates how to use the 2d amrclaw code to
perform adaptive refinement in 1d.   The routines qinit.f and rpn2.f have
been adapted from the 1d versions.

Plot the results using plotclaw1.
